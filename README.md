# Hidden-Markov-Models-Initials
Date: 21/04/2024, By: Martín Farfán, with the Support of Beritan Inci and Francisca Cajas. 

This was a laboratory in R of Hidden Markov Models on various datasets, with the help of Professor Antonello Maruotti. The final project was "Proyecto_MC_HMM", where the initialization of the HMM model was done with a Gaussian Mixture Model. This project was done with Pollution data on the city of Rieti.
